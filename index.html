                              I have had the opportunity to pass the International English Language Testing System, or IELTS, certification at my school.
                              IELTS is a globally recognized language proficiency test that measures a person's ability to communicate in 
                              English in an academic or professional setting. 
                              It is recognized by over 10,000 institutions in over 140 countries, including universities, employers,
                               and immigration authorities.<br><br>
                              The IELTS test consists of four parts: listening, reading, writing, and speaking. The listening and reading sections are 
                              the same for both the Academic and General Training tests, while the writing and speaking sections are different.
  
                              IELTS scores are based on a band scale from 0 to 9, with 9 being the highest level of proficiency. Scores are reported in whole and half bands, 
                              and test takers receive a separate score for each of the four test components.<br>

                              Demand for data talent far exceeds the supply of qualified candidates. This has made 
                              recruiting data talent extremely difficult and competitive. 
                              Datacamp's certification programs help me stand out and prove my skills are job-ready to potential employers.
                              It show employers my analytical and technical prowess with DataCamp's highly regarded Data Scientist certification: proof 
                              that I know how to wrangle data and uncover nuggets of business gold.<br>
                              Datacamp's certification process consists of timed exams focused on exploratory analysis,
                              data management, model development, and statistical experimentation. I will also show our experts my data science
                              programming abilities, how well I communicate my
                              findings and analyses, and that I can adeptly use <code>Python</code> or <code>R</code> alongside <code>SQL</code> for data science tasks and processes.
                              The Data Scientist certification was built on a foundation of job market data. That means I am not getting a generic
                              certificate — I am gaining a certification that's designed to prove I have the in-demand skills required for today's data jobs.<br>

                          being able to read and understand French literature allows you to access a rich and diverse range of 
                          cultural works and insights. 
                          I've started my journey improving my French language skills since 2006, I have considered
                          reading regularly, practicing my 
                          French language skills with natives and classmates, and learning about French literary history and cultural context. 
                          By immersing myself in French literature, 
                          I could deepen my understanding and appreciation of the language and its cultural significance.

                          It is wonderful that I am a native speaker of Arabic and proficient in this language. Being a native speaker of this
                          language means that I have a natural fluency and understanding of the language, which can be a valuable asset in both personal 
                          and professional contexts. As a native speaker, I have a strong foundation in Arabic and have a natural ability to understand 
                          and use the language with ease, even when it comes to multiple other dialects (e.g Egyptian, Tunisian, Algerian,...). 
                          To continue improving my Arabic language skills, I keep reading and writing regularly, especially with my parents I keep
                          practicing speaking with them, and learning about it's <strong>infinite</strong> grammar and vocabulary. 
                          By staying engaged with the language, I can continue to develop my skills and deepen my understanding my language and culture.

                          I have been learning German for almost 2 years now, and I will be going to a semester abroad in Freiburg in Germany.
                          Learning German can be a great way to expand my social skills and connect with others.<br>
                          German is a widely spoken language in Europe and around the world, and learning it can open up many opportunities for communication and 
                          connection with native speakers. By learning German, I can participate in conversations with native speakers, 
                          understand German media and culture, and make new connections with people from German-speaking countries. In addition, 
                          learning a new language helps improve my communication skills and ability to understand and empathize with others, 
                          which can be valuable social skills in general contexts and professional ones. 
                          By dedicating myself to learning and practicing German, I can expand my social skills and broaden my horizons even more.

            <p class="lead text-dark text-center text-md-start mt-5">In my spare time I like to think about game ideas, and creative ways 
              to build games and web applications. In fact, this website was a mere course to understand <code>Bootstrap</code> and have a better understading 
              in creating websites and embedding games in them.<br>
              Having a hobby of playing and creating video games can be a great way to develop 
              and hone my problem-solving skills and explore my interests in computer science. Video games or arcade games often require players to think critically 
              and creatively to solve challenges and progress through the game. By playing and creating video games, I can develop my ability to 
              analyze problems, think logically, and come up with creative solutions. This can be a valuable skill in a career in computer science, 
              where problem-solving is a key aspect of the work. Additionally, creating video games can give my hands on experience with computer 
              science concepts and technologies, such as programming, game theory and design, and computer graphics. By combining your passion for video games 
              with your career aspirations in computer science, you can continue to develop your skills and explore your interests in a meaningful way.<br>
              I hope you check my humble web games and gadgets and try them out!
